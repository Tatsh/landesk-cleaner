# LANDESK cleaner

Brute-force method to start, stop and uninstall [LANDESK/Ivanti](https://www.ivanti.com/company/history/landesk) from your Mac. You must have root privileges to be able to use any scripts in this package.

You must also have [lunchy](https://rubygems.org/gems/lunchy/) installed, which can be installed by running: `gem install lunchy`. `lunchy` must be in `PATH`.

Run these scripts at your own risk!
